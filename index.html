                            <strong>Rem</strong> (Japanese: レム, Remu), is the Shinigami who gives Misa Amane one of the
                            Death
                            Notes
                            she had. Like Ryuk, Rem possesses two Death Notes; however, Rem did not get hers through
                            trickery.
                            The
                            Shinigami Gelus, who had fallen in love with Misa, sacrificed himself to kill her destined
                            murderer.
                            In
                            doing so he was reduced to dust, leaving only his Death Note. Rem delivered this Death Note
                            to Misa,
                            since it was her life he saved.

                            Wammy's House, Watari's orphanage for gifted children in Winchester, England. When Roger
                            asks that Mello and Near work together to capture Kira, Mello refuses, pointing out the
                            differences between them. He leaves the orphanage soon after and eventually seeks help from
                            the Mafia.

                            as the Hand of Kira by Light Yagami. Mikami takes ownership of Gelus's Death Note after
                            Light falls under suspicion of being Kira again, and needs someone to act as Kira without
                            being given every order. His personality is best described as meticulous, disciplined, and unbending in his convictions.
                            Mikami's unwavering commitment to justice is his defining trait. He believes in Kira's cause and the elimination of criminals through divine judgment.
